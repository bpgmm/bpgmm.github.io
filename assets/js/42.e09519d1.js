Due to the limited number of available authentic standards, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis is a crucial method in metabolite annotation. However, it is very easy to overlook low quality spectra which carry a higher risk of miss-annotation. For this reason, a profound study of hundreds of MS/MS spectra from several biological studies have been performed to establish criteria for evaluation of spectral quality. As a result, a pentagonal-point evaluation system including aspects such as overall intensity of spectra, impact of noise, number of MS/MS scans obtained, co-eluting ions and cross-talk phenomena has been established. These aspects are evaluated giving a partial score between 0 and 1. Then, an overall score is calculated by summation of all previously obtained scores and used to classify spectra as excellent, acceptable or inadequate in a three-tier scoring system.")])])}],!1,null,null,null);t.default=i.exports}}]);
