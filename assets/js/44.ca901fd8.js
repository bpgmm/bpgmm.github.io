Following this, it can be assumed that the collision cell, between different scans, is completely free of any ions preventing overlap of signals originating from different molecules. However, often the ions from one scan are delayed by fragmentation and are still ongoing when the next scan starts, especially in the case of very short inter-scan delay. This results in the mixture of ions reaching the detector, a phenomenon called cross-talk. It influences both qualitative and quantitative analysis and becomes more problematic when the acquisition rate is increased.\nIf there is no cross-talk in the MS/MS spectrum, the identification is feasible for this parameter. If the cross-talk has a low intensity, the identification is still possible since the main fragments formed are distinguishable based on their intensity, and a hard cross-talk hinders the identification of the parent ion.\nFragmentation of a particular ion produces a series of its product ions which have smaller m/z than the molecule from which they originate. Consequently, a typical MS/MS spectrum does not have ions with higher mass than the precursor, unless some dimmers or clusters were formed.
