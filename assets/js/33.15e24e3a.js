The number of parameters in the get method would make the request very long and tedious, therefore the requests are accepted only through the POST method. The PUT and DELETE methods are restricted to the administrators of the software tool. The format for exchange the data with CMM services is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) included in the body (see SI 2 for the attributes allowed). JSON has become the main format for the data exchange over the internet, and it is commonly supported for most of the standards, tools and technologies.
