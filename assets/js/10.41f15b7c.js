LC is the most used separation technique due to its versatility without losing too much reproducibility.\nLC-MS data provides a set of experimental masses (m/z) and retention times. These data pairs are known as features. Those features with the same retention time may be derived from the same analyte. In this case, some of the experimental masses correspond to in-source fragmentation due to the breaking of some parts of the precursor ion.\nThere are software tools for peak detection as CAMERA that use the peak size and the isotopic profile information for grouping the peaks taking information from the shape of the peak and the isotopic profile. This software tools for peak detection assign the features related to the same group, but in most of the cases, they do not perform an identification of the peaks based on MS/MS data from the putative precursor ions. They group the features and they assign the possible adduct and/or neutral loose suffered by the feature, but the subsequent identification has to be performed.\nDue to that, CMM has developed a system where the user can introduce a RT window where all the features will be checked to establish relation between different adducts corresponding to the same ionization mode (positive or negative). This process is called adduct detection. Moreover, it checks if some of the peaks with no relation can correspond to fragments of the features with a higher m/z due to in-source fragmentation.\nTo do that, it looks into the fragmentation spectra of putative annotations of the compounds with a higher m/z. The MS/MS spectra information of the compounds has been integrated from HMDB (experimental and predicted spectra).\nA retention time zero will be assigned for those features without retention time. Features with retention time zero will not be grouped together, as they do not provide information about the elution time into the separation column.\nThe full process of the LC-MS search grouping the features by their RT is:")]),e._v(" "),a("ol",[a("li",[e._v("CMM assigns different groups depending on the tolerance introduced by the user.")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("CMM tries to detect the adduct based on the relationships between peaks within a group.")]),e._v(" "),a("li",[e._v("The putative annotations corresponding to different adducts are assigned to each feature.
